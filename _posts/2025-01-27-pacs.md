## 1. What is PACS?
PACS(Picture Archiving and Communication System) is more than just an image storage system. It's a comprehensive medical imaging technology that manages how diagnostic images are stored, accessed, and shared within healthcare environments. Working hand in hand with DICOM, PACS serves as the backbone of modern medical imaging infrastructure.

Key points that make PACS essential:
- Centralizes medical image storage and management
- Enables seamless sharing across healthcare facilities
- Provides secure and efficient access to medical images
- Integrates with other healthcare information systems

Leading healthcare institution demonstrate PACS effectiveness:
- Mayo Clinic processes 2.5 million images annually using Phillips PACS
- Johns Hopkins Hospital employs AI-powered PACS for real-time image analysis

## 2. How PACS Works
A PACS workflow consists of four fundamental steps:

### 2-1. Image Acquisition
Think of this as the entry point of mediacl images:
- Patients undergo various imaging tests (X-ray, CT, MRI)
- Medical equipment generates digital images

### 2-2. Image Transfer
Here's where the data moves:
- Images are automatically transmitted to PACS servers
- Uses DICOM as the standard medical imaging format

### 2-3. Storage
The core repository function:
- Images are stored on high-capacity servers
- Systematic classification with patient information

### 2-4. Retrieval
The user interaction phase:
- Physicians can access images via computers
- Advanced features include 3D conversion, zoom, and brightness adjustment

## 3. Core Technical Components
### 3-1. DICOM Protocol Implementation
Essential standards that ensure:
- Standardized medical imaging protocols
- Compliance with image transmission and storage regulations
- Compatibility across various medical devices

### 3-2. Database Management
Critical data handling features:
- Large-scale medical data indexing
- Quick search and retrieval capabilities
- Effective metadata management

### 3-3. Network Communication
Key networking capabilities:
- Reliable transmission of large data volumes
- Real-time image streaming
- Optimized network bandwidth usage

### 3-4. Security Measures
Protection mechanisms including:
- Medical information encryption
- Access control and authorization management
- Data integrity assurance

## 4. System Architecture
PACS operates through four distict layers:
### 4-1. Acquisition Layer
The initial capture phase includes:
- Data collection from imaging equipment
- DICOM format conversion
- Image quality verification
- Metadata generation

### 4-2. Display Layer
The visualization component provides:
- High-resolution diagnostic viewers
- Clinical viewers
- Web-based viewing solutions

Key features include:
- Image manipulation tools
- Diagnostic utilities
- 3D rendering capabilities
- Measurement and annotation tools

### 4-3. Archive Layer
Storage management including: 
- Backup systems
- Storage management
- Data retrieval capabilities
- Storage policy administration

### 4-4. Integration Layer
System management features:
- Workflow management
- System integration
- User administration
- System monitoring
